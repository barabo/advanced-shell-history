  [ ] rewrite the schema to allow easy per-host aggregation (session must include a machine ID)
  [ ] add a script to cut a new release
  [ ] write more interesting queries
  [ ] enable tab completion for query names
  [ ] finish the ip address feature in unix.py to use ASH_CFG_ variables
  [ ] test with cssh localhost x10 for db locking and timeout settings - tune
