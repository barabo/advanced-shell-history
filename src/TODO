  [ ] If ASH_CFG_HISTORY_DB is undefined, assume they don't know what the command / utility is - have a more inviting message.  If you are setting this up for the first time, please see http://sites.google.com/projects/advanced_shell_history/...
  [ ] add a flag to log to stderr or a specific file?
  [ ] add a --debug flag to turn on debugging output to stderr by default.

BUGS

WISHLIST (harder things that would be nice to have):
  [ ] find a safe way to get the 'builtin type' details for a command (without re-executing it)
  [ ]   add an option to ignore non-commands: ASH_CFG_IGNORE_NON_COMMANDS='true'  # this avoids keeping passwords and/or junk commands in your database.
  [ ] make LOG(ERROR) and above also go to stderr - this is actually not easy, given the way the logger works now.
  [ ] design a shell history function that attempts to intercept builtin history calls and redirect to builtin history wherever necessary ???
